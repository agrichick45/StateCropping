<h2 id="usda-nass-data">USDA NASS Data</h2>
<p>State Crop Production Data from 1990-2021 in acres. The NASS data for each crop was downloaded by state, and trimmed into three columns in Microsoft Excel: Year, State, and Acres. The total land area of each state is noted in the GIS shapefiles. The square meter values were turned to acreages using the calculate function in an attribute table, and then the attribute table was exported to a .csv file for use in calculating the total crop area</p>
<p>Once the file is read in and transformed, with new percentages calculated, the data is linked to a second function that transforms the data into a matrix format for use in the creation of heatmaps and plots.</p>
<p>And this function uses the data matrix from the above functions, and transfers the matrix dataframe to a graphical heat map based on the crop selected.</p>
